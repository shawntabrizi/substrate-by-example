Substrate tries to be the best platform for both new and experienced blockchain developers. But it
goes without saying that to be truly successful using Substrate, you will need to learn Rust.

Substrate is a complex project that pushes advance rust features to the extreme. Unfortunately, this
section will not make you a Rust expert, but it will be a high level review of Rust and how you
might see Substrate use the features of this language with regard to runtime development.

If you had to take one piece of advice from me, it would be to try and learn Rust first, and then
learn Substrate. Here are some great resources from real Rust experts that will help you on your
journey:

* The Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
